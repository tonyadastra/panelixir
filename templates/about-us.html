                <p style="font-family: Noto Sans, sans-serif;"> Tony is a 16-year-old teenager who loves computer science. He was an exchange student to Dwight School New York
                    when the city became the global epicenter of COVID-19. During that time, he visited webpages tracking the
                    number of cases in each country over five times a day, seeing the number of cases growing swiftly every day.
                    He felt that checking growing coronavirus cases doesn't make him feel good every day, and thought maybe positivity is
                    what people needs more during this pandemic. During a conversation with his dad, he was inspired by the idea of tracking the progress of
                    vaccines instead of the number of cases. With all the hope and passion, he and his friend Lola spent nearly a month on building this website,
                    wishing to help more people and spread positivity during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
