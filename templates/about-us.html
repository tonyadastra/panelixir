                <p class="intro-us" style="font-family: Noto Sans, sans-serif;"> Tony is a 17-year-old teenager currently studying at Burlingame High School. He was an exchange student at Dwight School New York
                    when the city became the global epicenter of COVID-19. Inspired by the unity that New Yorkers displayed during the daily 7pm applause, he thought that a vaccine-tracking website
                    will spread the much-needed  hope and positivity during the pandemic. Driven by this purpose and his passion for technology, he and his friend Xuran spent nearly two months on building this website. In addition to researching vaccine development, he is currently working to provide the latest information about COVID-19 vaccinations.</p>

                <p class="intro-us" style="font-family: Noto Sans, sans-serif;">Xuran is a first-year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University and has achieved her Bachelor's degree at UC San Diego,
                    double majored in Computer Science and Applied Math. She has always paid close attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. After getting the invitation from Tony, she thought
                    it is a perfect idea to develop a platform that tracks the process of vaccine development. Given the urgent need for vaccines and the large number of companies that
                    are working on developing treatments, they aim to provide a user-friendly website where people can get the latest and the most accurate update on the development of vaccines.</p>
