                <p style="font-family: Noto Sans, sans-serif;"> Tony is a 16-year-old teenager who loves computer science. He was an exchange student to Dwight School New York
                    when the city became the global epicenter of COVID-19. During that time, he visited webpages tracking the
                    number of cases in each country over five times a day, seeing the number of cases growing swiftly every day.
                    He felt that checking growing coronavirus cases doesn't make him feel good every day, and thought maybe positivity is
                    what people needs more during this pandemic. During a conversation with his dad, he was inspired by the idea of tracking the progress of
                    vaccines instead of the number of cases. With all the hope and passion, he and his friend Lola spent nearly a month on building this website,
                    wishing to help more people and spread positivity during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center cursive">Lola Liu</h4>
                <p>Lola is a first year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University and has achieved her bachelor degree at UC San
                Diego, double majored in Computer Science and Applied Math. She has always paid close attention to the COVID19 pandemic.
                After getting the invitation from Tony, she thought it is a perfect idea to develop a platform that tracks the process
                of vaccine development. Given the urgent need of vaccines and the large number of companies that is working on
                developing treatments, they aim to provide a user-friendly website where people can get the latest and the most accurate
                update.</p>
